  The default branch used for the latest stable release. This branch is protected and typically is only merged with release branches.
- **development**
  The main branch for server development. PRs should target this.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep Them Small**
  If you're fixing a bug, try to keep the changes to the bug fix only. If you're adding a feature, try to keep the changes to the feature only. This will make it easier to review and merge your changes.
- **Perform a Self-Review**
  Before submitting your changes, review your own code. This will help you catch any mistakes you may have made.
- **Remove Noise**
  Remove any unnecessary changes to white space, code style formatting, or some text change that has no impact related to the intention of the PR.
- **Create a Meaningful Title**
  When creating a PR, make sure the title is meaningful and describes the changes you've made.
- **Write Detailed Commit Messages**
  Bring out your table manners, speak the Queen's English and be on your best behaviour.

### Style Guide

 TODO: style guidance
 Ensure that your code is automatically formatted whenever you save a file.

### Tests

We have a number of tests that are run automatically when you submit a pull request. You can run these tests locally by running The unit test sub-project. If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, please conceder adding tests to cover your changes so that we can ensure they don't break in the future.
